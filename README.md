# CS111 Intro to Computer Science Spring 2015 Final Project
A simple turn based game written in Java for an introductory level computer science course. The game itself is a modified animation that uses user inputs to act as a "turn", which progresses the game.

The objective of the game is to get the character sprite from the top of the screen to the bottom, without coming into contact with the two reporter sprites. Upon each turn, the character sprite can choose to move one step, or to stay in place by entering a string with one space, or two spaces respectively. 

Note: The Animation, IO, and Sprite files were given by the course instructors. All original work is contained within the Movie and Rectangle files.
